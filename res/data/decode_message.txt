Do you have what it takes to crack the code? Take your first guess and let's get started
I guess you really are the true mastermind...
Good game!
Was this the start you were looking for?
An interesting opening...
'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step...'
Last guess, better make it count
Looks like it's time to do-or-die
Aww, look at you, contemplating your choices... Cute.
Looks like I win today ;)
Commendable effort, codebreaker
Better luck next time :P
So close, yet so far
Dare I say, 'GGEZ'?
Oh wow, are you even trying?
A swing and a miss...
*Outstanding move*
I think you're on to something and I don't quite like it
Getting close now, are we?
I would be lying if I said I'm not somewhat concerned
Interesting...
That was unexpected...
Not bad...
What's happening here?
Perhaps you may be on to something
Soooo... How's the weather?
Do you really know what you're doing?
*Yawn*
Is this what you expected?
Are you worried? Signs point to yes
You know, I could've guessed the code by now
